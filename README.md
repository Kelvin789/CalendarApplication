# CalendarApplication
Records appointments onto a C# calendar application (reads/stores entries onto a text file).

This was a project for a 1st year module from university. A partially implemented project was provided and I was required to complete the application. Specifically, the application is designed to help clients keep track of appointments at their business (similar to MS outlook). The main features were to:
-	Write classes to manage/store entries
-	Write the Windows forms to enter details of new entries in the calendar and edit existing entries
-	Integrate code into the incomplete parts of the application and allow users to create new entries in the calendar, edit existing ones and delete entries

The project was developed/tested on Visual Studio 2017.
